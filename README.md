## Riddle

Two mathematicians met who had not seen each other for a long time.

How many children do you have?

Three.

How old are they?

– If you multiply their ages, you get 36

– I can’t give an answer, there’s not enough information.

– If you sum up their ages, it’s your house number.

– This data is not enough for me.

The second mathematician thought a little and said:

The eldest son has blue eyes.

After which the answer was given.



## Solution

There were 8 possible solutions, mostly with different sums of ages. Obviously, the mathematician knew his house number, but it still kept him thinking because by looking at the given data, there are 2 solutions with the same sum: 6, 6, 1 (sum of 13) and 9, 2, 2 (sum of 13). So, it leaves the solution among these 2. However, since it was said that the eldest son has blue eyes, it means there is only 1 oldest son, which obviously just leaves one possible solution of: 9, 2, 2.
